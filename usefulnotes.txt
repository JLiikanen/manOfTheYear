Should I use the summary attribute or just use the line break as a separator to find the first paragraph?
    It is line break vs summary. -> Line break is a better separator, it basically eliminates overly-long summaries
    while keeping most summaries as it is already a common separator there.


requirements:
        python 3.10 -> I used this version. Probably works fine on all python 3.0 versions and above.
        wikipedia >=1.4.0
        pandas >= 1.5.1
        plotly >= 5.11.0
        streamlit >= 1.15.0
